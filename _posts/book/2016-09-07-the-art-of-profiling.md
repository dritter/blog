      description: Dan Korem, a critically acclaimed investigative journalist, developed a landmark system for profiling and reading people within just a few minutes of interaction—and in many cases, without asking any questions. In fact, you will learn how to read people whom you have never met—even if you can't speak their language. This is made possible by answering just four direct questions in your mind about someone. Once answered, you access a profile that details how a person prefers to Communicate, Perform Tasks, and Make Decisions.
