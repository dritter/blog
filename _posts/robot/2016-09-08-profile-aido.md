    ├── Emotion
    │   ├── facial expression generation (total emotions unknown)
    │   └── inner states (awake, notification, blink/sleep)
    └── Modularity
        ├── detachable top unit with external battery
        ├── runs all android apps
        ├── smart appliance kit
        │   ├── 3 smart plugs (plug to an A/C or water heater to control)
        │   └── 2 smart bulbs
        └── smart charging dock for auto charge

The smart appliance kit allows you to control appliances that do not have interactive capabilities built in.

Without the mobility module, you'll get a static personal assistant like Tapia or Jibo, with 8 hours of battery lifetime or plugged to a power source.

The drawback so far is the extremely short battery lifetime (only 2 hours with mobility).
