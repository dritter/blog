[Pepper](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/cool-robots/pepper) is a humanoid-like robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics.

It is claimed to be the first robot to be able to adapt its behavior based on recognized human emotion.
Although it is too early to call Pepper a "companion robot", it has several features summarized as follows.

	Pepper
	├── Move
    │   ├── head + neck rotation
    │   └── arms, waist and knees joints
    ├── Navigate
    │   ├── 3 multi-directional wheels
    │   └── auto collision & obstacle avoidance
    ├── See
    │   ├── emotion recognition (see Emotion section)
    │   ├── facial/object detection
    │   ├── facial/object recognition
    │   └── take photos/videos
    ├── Speak
    │   └── text-to-speech
    │       └── supports English and Japanese
    ├── Hear
    │   └── speech recognition
    │       └── supports English and Japanese
    ├── Entertain
    │   ├── basic conversation with users
    │   ├── dance
    │   └── play (not sure what kind of games)
    ├── Network
    │   └── connected to internet
    │       ├── keep up with latest news
    │       └── find recipes (not read, only find)
    ├── AI
    │   ├── maintain posture balance
    │   ├── adapt to individual preferences and personality
    │   └── understand his environment (HOW??)
    ├── Emotion
    │   ├── can identify joy, sadness, anger and surprise
    │   ├── interpreting a smile, frown, voice tone
    │   ├── verbal and non-verbal cues
    │   └── gesture and symbol generation (total emotions unknown)
    └── Modularity
        └── downloadable additional apps        

The drawback so far is the predetermined algorithm of how to deal with the recognized emotions (i.e., If you are happy, Pepper will share your joy, and if you are sad, Pepper will comfort you).

There is no flexibility of shaping Pepper's behavior and personality.
At this rate, interaction will Pepper will become monotonic and users will get bored easily.

Good news is, to compensate the lack of robot companion features, Pepper's battery life lasts for approx. 12 hours.
