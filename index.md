This blog was initiated to keep my compiled programming notes altogether in one place where I have access at all time, instead of handling multiple version of files in the cloud or different devices.

Recently, I've decided to share my personal interest, i.e. music and books. This also serves as a reminder to self, and even better when came acrossed visitors who shared the same interest.

Feel free to share your thoughts!
